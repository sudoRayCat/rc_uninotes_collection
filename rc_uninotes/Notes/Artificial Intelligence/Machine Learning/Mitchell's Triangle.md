The triangle is defined with 3 points Task (T), Experience (E), and Performance (P). 

Then the program learns from E with respect to some class of T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

1. What's that task?
2. What data/experience do we have?
3. How will we measure performance (aligned with decisions & costs?) 

Example: Spam Email Filtering 
- **Task (T)**: classify emails as spam or not spam.
- **Experience (E)**: past emails labelled by users as spam/not spam.
- **performance (P)**: accuracy, or something like "percentage of spam caught with acceptable false alarms".
