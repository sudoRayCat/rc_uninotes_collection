aliases:
  - CMRR
---

The amount of common mode noise rejected by the circuit. Used in [[Differential Amplifiers]] when there is a //common mode// and //differential mode// component.


# Equations 

CMRR can be expressed is its $V/V$ or logarithmic (decibels) forms. 

$$CRMM=\frac{|A_{d}|}{|A_{cm}|}$$
or 

$$CRMM=20 \log \left( \frac{|A_{d}|}{|A_{cm}|} \right)$$
